# Module-6-Assignment-Fashion-MNIST-Classification with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is designed to categorize clothing items into 10 different classes.

## Project Overview

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, each associated with a label from 10 classes of clothing items. This project aims to build and train a CNN model to accurately classify these images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script:

   ```
   python fashion_mnist_cnn.py
   ```

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:
1. Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel)
2. MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
3. Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel)
4. MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
5. Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel)
6. Flatten
7. Dense (64 units)
8. Dense (10 units, softmax activation)

## Results

After training for 10 epochs:
- Training Accuracy: 94.44%
- Validation Accuracy: 90.94%
- Test Accuracy: 90.41%

These results indicate that the model has learned to classify Fashion MNIST images with high accuracy.

## Visualization Interpretation

The script generates visualizations for two test images along with their predicted and true labels. Here's how to interpret these visualizations:

1. Image Display: The grayscale image of the clothing item is shown.
2. Predicted Label: The class name predicted by the model is displayed below the image.
3. Prediction Confidence: The percentage next to the predicted class name indicates the model's confidence in its prediction.
4. True Label: The actual class of the item is shown in parentheses.
5. Color Coding: 
   - Blue text indicates a correct prediction
   - Red text indicates an incorrect prediction

This visualization helps in qualitatively assessing the model's performance and understanding its strengths and weaknesses in classifying different types of clothing items.

## Improving the Model

While the current model performs well, there are several ways to potentially improve its performance:

1. Data Augmentation: Implement techniques like random rotations, flips, or zooms to artificially expand the training dataset and improve the model's generalization.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, or optimizer algorithms to find the optimal configuration.

3. Architecture Modifications:
   - Add more convolutional layers to capture more complex features
   - Experiment with different filter sizes or numbers of filters
   - Try adding dropout layers to prevent overfitting

4. Transfer Learning: Utilize pre-trained models on larger datasets and fine-tune them for the Fashion MNIST task.

5. Ensemble Methods: Train multiple models with different architectures or initializations and combine their predictions.

6. Learning Rate Scheduling: Implement a learning rate decay schedule to fine-tune the model's learning process over time.

7. Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance and to help in hyperparameter tuning.

8. Error Analysis: Analyze the confusion matrix to identify which classes are most often misclassified and focus on improving those specific cases.

9. Longer Training: If resources allow, train the model for more epochs while monitoring for overfitting.

10. Regularization Techniques: Experiment with L1/L2 regularization or other regularization methods to prevent overfitting.

The systematical application and testing of these improvements can potentially enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
